# cryosparc_deep_2d
deep 2d using cryosparc 

but

maybe only 1 iter is enough .

copy files into cryosparc_master/cryosparc_compute/jobs/  (and restart cryoSPARC) thus create a new job 

copy deep2d.py and run.sh to your ~/bin/ (somewhere you put your own packages )

This is a test version . You should change some settings.
